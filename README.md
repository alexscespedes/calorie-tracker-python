Training project to get knowledge with programming

##Calorie Tracker in Python - Data Visualization Project

The idea of this project is referenced from this video [NeuralNine](https://youtu.be/2Iid9rAo6sE) where data visualization with Matplotlib and Numpy are applied.

I believe that it takes perseverance and hard work to understand and create useful projects on our own.

Any feedback or improvement is welcome!
